This repository contains Java programs that implement fundamental OOP concepts;

Abstraction
Concepts Covered:
Abstract class Appliance
Abstract method turnOn()
Concrete subclasses Fan and TV
Demonstrates abstraction through method implementation in subclasses
Abstract class Appliance defines turnOn().
Fan and TV extend Appliance and implement turnOn().
Objects of Fan and TV are created and their methods invoked.

Encapsulation
Concepts Covered:
Private attributes (name and grade)
Public getter and setter methods
Grade validation (should be between 0-100, otherwise set to 0)
Creates a Student class with private attributes.
Uses setters to ensure grade is within valid range.
Demonstrates encapsulation by restricting direct access to attributes.

Exception Handling
Concepts Covered:
Handling ArithmeticException
User input validation
try-catch-finally block implementation
Accepts two numbers from the user.
Attempts to divide the first number by the second.
Catches division by zero error and displays an appropriate message.

Method Overloading and Overriding
Method Overloading
Demonstrates multiple multiply() methods:
One takes two integers.
One takes three integers.
Method Overriding
Demonstrates polymorphism using makeSound() method.
Dog and Cat classes override makeSound() method of Animal class.
Calls overridden methods dynamically using polymorphism.
